   ["No, she'll probably make me do it. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.", "Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Really?! Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.", "Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Shut up and take my money! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.", "That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!", "Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.", "WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. But I've never been to the moon! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!", "Really?! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Then we'll go with that data file!", "If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems."]
